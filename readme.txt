FRONT END WEB DEVELOPMENT
=========================
	*	The module, Front end web development helped me lot and gave me theoretical and practical understanding of HTML 5, CSS 3 techniques and JavaScript.
	*	Most of the pages of this project, I used Bootstrap to make the pages responsive. I also make individual CSS for each page.
	*	I checked with different browser and found best experience in Google Chrome.
	*	There is a common navigation bar for each page. I used animation at the top of the each page where company name move from left top towards right and iterate six times. This animation is also responsive with the screen size so it will not overlap the navigation context. It also use navigation bar for small screen.
	*	The webpage consists of four pages. They are home, photo Gallery, Menu and contact us.
	*	At the home page I setup a background image which is responsive with screen size. Text colour and text size also change with the screen size.
	*	In Photo gallery, I used background image but applied rgba() attribute to make it dark. At the top there is a carousel where I used javaScript and bootstrap to change image after 2 seconds and iterate indefinitely. There have image gallery which is divided into three part. User will able to see image when they click on the button. 
	*	Menu pages, I used Jason data object to display my menu Which is totally new experience for me to use this technique. Jason data in separate files and used JavaScript to get that data and display on the page.
	*	In contact us page, I used Google API to show the map on the page and one contact form which validate the user input locally.
